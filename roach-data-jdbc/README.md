# Roach Demo Data :: JDBC

A CockroachDB Spring Boot Demo using [Spring Data JDBC](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-jdbc)
for data access.

Spring Data JDBC provides a simpler, yet powerful model than JPA or any other ORM frameworks. It's considered a good 
fit for data access logic that doesn't involve large, complex domain model mapping or any of the advanced features 
of JPA, such as lazy loading, second level caching, auto-batching and transparent persistence.
    
The JDBC demo has most code comments and also provides a few extra features compared to the other modules.
