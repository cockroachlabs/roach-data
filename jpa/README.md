# Roach Demo Data :: JPA/Hibernate

A CockroachDB Spring Boot Demo using [Spring Data JPA](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-jpa)
with Hibernate for data access.

Spring Data JPA provides a powerful model for using ORM frameworks such as Hibernate. It's considered a good 
fit for data access logic that involve large, complex domain model mapping. Spring Data JPA essentially
removes the need for application code to bind directly to Hibernate APIs. It also unlocks many advanced 
features of JPA.
